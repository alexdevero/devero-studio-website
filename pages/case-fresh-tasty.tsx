            <p>This project was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and PHP, mainly for forms. We didn't use any front-end or back-end framework. Next.js made it also easier to create high-performance website, thanks to code splitting, advanced bundling and automatic assets optimization. The whole website was built as a system of components that could be re-used elsewhere. This made it easier to gradually extend the website to its final size.</p>

            <p className="mt-3">We were always working on page at the time. When page was finished we went through extensive testing and reviews with Fresh & Tasty CEO. Only when any potential issues were solved the page was accepted and we started working on another page.</p>

            <p>We've built the website as from scratch with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We didn't use any front-end or back-end framework. During the work, we followed the best practices for asset optimization to make sure website will load fast, even on low-end devices and slow internet connection. The website has been thoroughly tested on a wide range of devices, from mobile phones and tablets, to small and large desktops to ensure maximum compatibility.</p>
