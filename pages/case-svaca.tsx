            <p>We were hired to build a pixel-perfect and responsive website for the whole project. When we started the project we received the design for the first five pages. As we worked on coding the first batch of pages, we also worked with the company's designer on the rest of pages. Through this collaboration we were able to design, and then code, the rest of pages.</p>

          <div className="col-sm-8">
            <p>We started this project by building the React app for the website using Next.js framework. Internal and router in Next.js made it easier to handle necessary routing. Next.js made it also easier to create high-performance website, thanks to code splitting, advanced bundling and automatic assets optimization. The whole website was built as a system of components that could be re-used elsewhere. This made it easier to gradually extend the website to its final size.</p>

            <p className="mt-3">We were always working on page at the time. When page was finished we went through extensive testing and reviews with Cerstva Svaca CEO. Only when any potential issues were solved the page was accepted and we started working on another page.</p>

          </div>

          <div className="col-sm-8">
            <p>We've built the website as on the top of Next.js framework, as a React app. We followed the best practices for asset optimization to ensure website will load fast, even on slow bandwidth and devices. This was further greatly enhanced by default optimization processes provided by Next.js framework. The layout of every page has been tested and optimized to create great experience on all devices, from mobile phones and tablets, to small and large desktops. Our component-based approach allowed for the website to be continually extended and upgraded in the future.</p>
